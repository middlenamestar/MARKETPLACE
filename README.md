# marketplace.‚Ñ¢

marketplace. is a creative space and front-end store. It is meant to be the one-stop shop! Come in for a delicious coffee, view the latest pieces from local fashion designers, or pick up some new records and books!! Or, just come and hang out! üå∏üçµ

This command-line application was built to manage marketplace.'s employee database. We love our employees! Get to know them, as well as all the roles we have in our store, and our departments üåà With the interface you can view, add, edit departments, roles, and employees. The application uses Inquirer.js to prompt and lead you through, while MySQL stores and retrieves all data!
